The code you have provided is for a React component that displays train tracking information. The component uses the MUI library for its styling.

To use this component, you will need to install the following dependencies:


npm install @mui/material
npm install axios


Once the dependencies are installed, you can import the component into your project and use it like any other React component.

Here is an example of how to use the component:


import React from "react";
import OutlinedCard from "./OutlinedCard";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <OutlinedCard />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;


The OutlinedCard component takes an array of train data as its prop. The train data should be in the following format:


[
  {
    "trainName": "Train Name",
    "trainNumber": "Train Number",
    "departureTime": {
      "Hours": "Hours",
      "Minutes": "Minutes",
      "Seconds": "Seconds",
    },
    "delayedBy": "Delay",
    "seatsAvailable": {
      "sleeper": "Number of Sleeper Seats Available",
      "AC": "Number of AC Seats Available",
    },
    "price": {
      "sleeper": "Price of Sleeper Seats",
      "AC": "Price of AC Seats",
    },
  },
]


Once the component has been rendered, it will display the train tracking information in a card. The card will include the train name, train number, departure time, delay, number of seats available, and price.

I hope this helps!
